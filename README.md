# Light Field Toolbox for MATLAB

Copyright (c) 2013-2020 by Donald G. Dansereau

This is a set of tools for working with light field imagery in MATLAB.  Please refer to README and LFToolbox.pdf for installation and usage instructions.

As of 16-Nov-2017 the toolbox lives here:
https://github.com/doda42/LFToolbox

The branch structure is:

* master: always the most recent release
* develop<version #>: preparing a new release, to be merged into master when complete
* develop: experimental functionality
* tags: keep track of each release

Code in the develop branches is incomplete, unstable, undocumented, and unsupported.  Use at your own risk.  Functions named LFX* are new/experimental and may not be included in the next release.
